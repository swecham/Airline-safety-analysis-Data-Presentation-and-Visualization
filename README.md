# Airline-safety-analysis-Data-Presentation-and-Visualization

Here we have the age-old question â€“ which is safer? Flying or Driving? Just the thought of being suspended at an altitude of 35,000 feet and at a speed of 500mph makes us nervous. 
Air crashes are often deemed catastrophic due to the number of people involved and low survival rate. On the other hand, we feel much safer commuting, running errands or going to vacation by driving a car. 
The data shows otherwise. 

This project is a practice exercise for the Data presentation and visualization. 
Visualizations are prepared using Tableau.
